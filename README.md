# LinkedListContinuous
CS 245 - Continuous LinkedList (optional assignment)

I reused the LinkedList from Lab 05 to test the function I wrote that determines whether or not the LinkedList is continuous.
The function that determines whether or not the LinkedList is continuous is defined right before the main() towards the bottom of the file; it is called findContinuousIndex()
